		Exchange your carbon credit for things you need in order to stay climate neutral.
		<br>1. 
		Calculate your lifetime environmental impact. A <a href="calculator.htm">comprehensive lifetime environmental impact calculator</a> is under construction. 
		<br>2. Use your keys to register your environmental impact on blockchain.
		<br>3. Smart contracts exchange your credit for other things you need, at the 
		<a href="credit.htm">
		rate of exchange that is estimated using hard science without conflict of interest</a>. The blockchain ledger keeps track of your environmental credit for you, providing a 
		<a href="mindmap.htm">safety net when you retire</a>. 
		<p>Example of a ledger of individual environmental impact:<br>
This graph shows the annual environmental impact of a fictitious person who worked in conventional farming for several decades and then switched farming operations to regenerative agriculture to offset her greenhouse gas emissions. She used her own work in selling longevity herbs to mitigate her social harm.
